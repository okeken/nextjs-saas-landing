          3. Local Challenges Are Fueling Global Innovations
        </h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Ironically, many of Nigeria's problems have spurred into opportunities
          for innovation:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">

          Conclusion: Betting on Nigeria is Betting on the Future
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Despite the macroeconomic headwinds — currency devaluation, inflation,
          and policy instability — investors continue to pour capital into
          Nigeria. This vision is simple: the hardest work isn't Africa's to
          solve.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Nigeria is one of the last mega-markets in the world where
          fundamentals still matter. Yes, it's risky. Yes, it's imperfect. But
          that's what makes it valuable.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As one investor summarize this year: "If a company can succeed here —
          it's a recession-proof thing. Africa's global future."

        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-8">
          So, when investors bet on Nigeria, they're not just funding startups.
          They're not building value.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          They're betting on the next generation of African innovators — and the
          future is already here.
