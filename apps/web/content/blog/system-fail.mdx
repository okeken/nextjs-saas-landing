## Introduction

Growth hides weaknesses.

As companies scale, systems that once worked quietly begin to strain. What breaks
first isn’t the product — it’s the infrastructure supporting it.

## Complexity Is the Silent Threat

Each new process adds friction.

Without intentional simplification, complexity compounds until teams slow down,
decisions bottleneck, and errors multiply.

## Systems Enable Autonomy

Strong systems reduce dependence on individuals.

They make behavior predictable, outcomes repeatable, and scale sustainable.

## Conclusion: Fix Systems Early

Operational debt accumulates invisibly.

The earlier systems evolve with growth, the longer companies remain resilient.
