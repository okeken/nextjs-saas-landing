## Introduction

Hard work is visible. Good decisions are not.

Many founders burn out trying to outwork problems that require clarity instead.

## Leverage Beats Effort

Effective founders focus on decisions that unlock disproportionate impact.

They remove obstacles, set direction, and empower teams.

## Constraint Is a Tool

Limits create focus.

By choosing what _not_ to do, founders preserve energy for what matters most.

## Conclusion: Decide Better

Leadership is not about intensity.

It’s about choosing wisely, consistently, and early.
